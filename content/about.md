I'm Julie Sparks and a current Security Engineer at Cloudflare.

I'm an avid reader. Many of my interests relate to travel, cybersecurity, economics and history (of most periods). I'm always looking to meet new people & learn new things. Currently working on using data science for large scale historical analysis, taking workshops on reverse engineering malware, and building out my own website (yes, this one).
